# RAINWATCH : Rainfall analytics and prediction data science project
## Project goal 
The project showcases data science skills and technologies that can help monitor and predict volatile natural variables. Here we use python to build the back and front ends of a simple web app for rainfall analytics and prediction in the United States.

## Project technical aspects 
As mentionned python is used to build this webapp. Plotly coupled with dash make up the visualisation components whereas pandas and numpy are used for data import, preprocessing and array manipulations. Sklearn machine learning is the package for machine learning tasks. Please refer to the requirements.txt file for the detailed list of libraries used. 
## Possible improvements 
The next version will bring forward to major improvements. First, by using MlFlow library we will implement a mlops approach to monitor and improve the machine learning training tasks and thus improve the prediction accuracy. Second, we deploy the webapp to a cloud host to have the service available online.
