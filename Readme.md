# RAINWATCH : Rainfall analytics and prediction data science project
## Project goal 
The project showcases data science skills and technologies that can help monitor and predict volatile natural variables. Here we use python to build the back and front ends of a simple web app for rainfall analytics and prediction in the United States.

## Project Machine learning component  
As mentionned python is used to build this webapp. Plotly coupled with dash make up the visualisation components whereas pandas and numpy are used for data import, preprocessing and array manipulations. 
However the main contribution is the machine learning aspects conducted with MLflow library.
